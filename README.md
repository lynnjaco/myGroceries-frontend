# What we built
My Groceries App is a project that we thoroughly enjoyed putting together. The goal was to create a website where you can create a grocery item, update , delete, and also see if the price and quantity of an item as well as the total cost of your grocery list. Yes, we're great planners !  You can also select an organic item of choice. There are  cues of yellow and red to depict s grocery item close to expire or already expired. The form fields allow you to select grocery item by name, category, quantity, price and organic.
